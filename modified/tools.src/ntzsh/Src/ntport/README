This version requires Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
all paths must be '/'-separated, not '\'-separated. For example, if
you set HOME or PATH in your .rc files or interactively, use '/' AND
drive letters.

Known Bugs:
----------

zed does not work too well.
binding a key to xxx-menu-complete will cause the shell to crash
if you type the bound key on an empty line.


Basic things to know:
---------------

1. Drive changes done with 'cd <drive:>'
(Or setopt autocd to get DOS-like behaviour as a side-effect.)

2. .COM files will need to be executed by specifying the extension (edit.com,
instead of just edit).

3. International keyboards should work if you setopt printeightbit. Note that
this will re-init the keymaps, so you may have to redo some bindkey mappings.
(NOREBIND now has no effect whatsoever.)
Also, if you change the console font (on NT) from the default raster type to
anything else, international characters may not be displayed properly.

zsh sets the code-page to 1252 (ansi) when it starts. For international
versions (far east for example,) this screws up the console. To avoid
the problem, set ZSH_DONTSETCP in the system environment, before zsh 
starts.


4.If you're using Windows 95 (as opposed to Win98 or higher), and see
  spurious linefeeds, set the environment variable ZSH_ISWIN95 to a 
  non-zero-length value, before the shell starts and the problem 
  should go away;

6. ZSHROOT:
----------
If the variable ZSHROOT is set, it will be prepended to the program
name if the program is not found during the normal search. So, if you
type /bin/zsh (or have that in a shell script), the shell will try:

1. /bin/zsh
2. /bin/zsh.exe
3. $ZSHROOT/bin/zsh
4. $ZSHROOT/bin/zsh.exe

(Note that a script with a line like #!C:/bin/tcsh.exe will not be
affected by 3 or 4).

As an exception the command /bin/sh will always be replaced by the
path to the zsh executable which is currently running itself. That
is, scripts starting with #!/bin/sh will be executed by the currently
running shell itself.

7. HOME directory:
-----------------
zsh sets the HOME directory if it's not already set, AND ZDOTDIR is not
set either. It uses the windows directory on win95, 
$HOMEDRIVE\$HOMEPATH on nt <4.0, and $USERPROFILE on NT 4.0 and higher.

If ZDOTDIR is set, zsh sets home to "youdonthavehomeset". This
is to avoid crashing in places where the shell expects a home directory. 
Picking a real default would defeat the purpose of not setting home.

8. PATHS:
---------
In general it's a BAD idea to expect zsh to work with paths that do
not have drive letters, e.g., '/','/bin' etc.


NT-specific builtins:
--------------------
* start: like cmd.exe's start
* title: ditto
* cls: Clear entire screen buffer instead of visible window.
* ps: list processes. with -w, lists window titles as well.
* shutdown: 

	shutdown -[r|l|f] now

(Even though no time argument is supported, "now" must be specified, EXCEPT
with -l .This is to prevent you from accidentally shutting the machine down.)
    -r reboots, -l logs you off and -f forces apps to terminate.

The default action is to shut the machine down.

NT-specific setopts:
------------------
* winntignorecase: ignore case in completions
* winntlamepathfix: convert the PATH environment variable back to 
   '\'-delimited instead of  '/'-delimited when each child process is forked.

* winntnoassociations: Do not try applications associated with extensions
                   if exec() fails.

* winntconvertbackslash: Convert backslashes to '/' when comparing named
	directories etc. May be useful if you derive HOME from '\'-delimited 
	environment variables

* winntwaitforguiapps: When set, makes the shell wait for win32 GUI apps
to terminate instead of spawning them asynchronously.

* winntnoquoteprotect: Turn off trying to escape quotes (") in a command.
While the escaping works with cygnus tools, it does not seem to work with
the MKS tools. Whatever side-effects you suffer when you set this option
are beyond my means to fix.

Arrow keys etc. and bindkey:
----------------------------
* Since windows does not generate codes for the keypad (arrow keys,
ins,delete etc., ) you will need to use a special options to bindkey
to bind these keys.
namely,

bindkey -N \\0xx some-funky-function

where the numeric code is between 0 and 33. The following shows
the default bindings for each key.

    /* F1 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F2 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F3 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F4 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F5 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F6 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F7 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F8 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F9 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F10 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F11 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F12 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F13 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F14 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F15 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F16 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F17 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F18 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F19 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F20 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F21 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F22 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F23 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* F24 */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* Pgup */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* Pgdn */ z_undefinedkey,
    /* end */ z_endofline,
    /* home */ z_beginningofline,
    /* left-arrow*/ z_backwardchar,
    /* up-arrow */ z_uplineorhistory,
    /* right-arrow */ z_forwardchar,
    /* down-arrow */ z_downlineorhistory,
    /* Ins */ z_overwritemode,
    /* Del */ z_deletechar,


For example, to bind F-1 to run-help, you would need:

bindkey -N \\000 run-help 

To bind left-arrow:

bindkey -N \\034 beginning-of-line   ( note that \034 is 28 decimal)

I haven't had a chance to thoroughly test this yet, so watch out for bugs.
